description: Keep your severs light and fast with composables.

H4 is a composable framework. Instead of providing a big core, you start with a lightweight app
instance and for every functionality, there is either a built-in utility or you can make yours.

Composable utilities have huge advantages comparing to traditional plugin/middleware approaches:

✅ Your server only includes and runs the code that is needed

✅ You can extend your server functionality easily without adding global plugins

✅ The API is cleaner and more explicit compared to global middleware and plugins

All utilities, have access to event object. This way they can access incoming request and use a
shared context with event.context.
