H4 is a delightful framework for building web servers with Dart. It's designed to give you
composable utilities to build your server with ease.

## Getting Started

Create your first H4 application in just a few lines of code:

```dart title="index.dart"
import 'package:h4/create.dart';

void main() async {
  var app = createApp(port: 5174);
  var router = createRouter();
  app.use(router);
  // Simply return values from your handlers and H4 handles serialization
  router.get("/", (event) => "Hello world")
}
```
